I'm Neil Kale, a second-year Master's student in Machine Learning at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ml.cmu.edu). I've also interned in the Safety, Evaluation, and Alignment Lab (SEAL) at [Scale AI](https://scale.com/research).

As a safety researcher, I'm optimistic about AI. There is a world where we wake up in American homes built in affordable cities, warmed by clean energy, ride e-bikes to high-speed rail stations, zipping from tight-knit communities into metropoles where we collaborate on social work, research, and art. 

This world is not a guarantee, and we will have to fight for it! I work on research that I hope will bring us closer to a safe, abundant future.
